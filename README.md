> We propose a novel CAD model generation network called CADTrans which is based on a code tree-guided transformer framework to autoregressively generate CAD construction sequences.
> - Firstly, three regularized discrete codebooks are extracted through vector quantized adversarial learning, with each codebook respectively representing  the features of Loop, Profile, and Solid.
> - Secondly, these codebooks  are used to normalize a CAD construction sequence into a structured code tree representation  which is then used to  train a standard transformer network to reconstruct the code tree.
> - Finally, the code tree is used as global information to guide the sketch-and-extrude method to recover the corresponding geometric information, thereby reconstructing the complete CAD model.


## Project Requirements üìã

### Environment & Dependencies üõ†Ô∏è
- Linux üêß
- Python 3.8 üêç
- PyTorch ‚â• 1.10 üî•
- CUDA ‚â• 11.4 ‚ö°

Create and activate the environment:
```
conda create --name cadtrans_env python=3.8 -y
conda activate cadtrans_env
```

- Install pythonocc following the instruction [here](https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core) (use mamba if conda is too slow).
- Install PyTorch and other dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data üóÇÔ∏è
Download our [raw data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rainforeast/CADTrans/resolve/main/cad_raw.rar?download=true), processed from [DeepCAD](https://github.com/ChrisWu1997/DeepCAD), into the `data` folder in the root of this repository.

The raw data need to be first converted to CADTrans format following the steps from [SkexGen](https://github.com/samxuxiang/SkexGen). You can also run the following script to process the data:

```
sh scripts/data_process.sh
```

Alternatively, you can download the already [pre-processed data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rainforeast/CADTrans/resolve/main/model.rar?download=true,https://huggingface.co/datasets/rainforeast/CADTrans/resolve/main/loop.rar?download=true,https://huggingface.co/datasets/rainforeast/CADTrans/resolve/main/solid.rar?download=true,https://huggingface.co/datasets/rainforeast/CADTrans/resolve/main/profile.rar?download=true)ü§ó

## Training üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
### Regularized Discrete Codebooks üìö
Train and extract the regularized solid codebooks with:

```
